All you need to do to use it:

1. Download the clock.zip file and extract the contents.

3. Upload the folder to your plugins directory.
4. Activate the "clock" plugin through the 'plugins' page in WP.
5. See "clock" widget options to adjust things like display size, clock style and so on. The widget settings take a minute to load to due rendering all the clock on one page.

It's all.
